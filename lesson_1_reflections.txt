1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff showed me the removed and added lines in old and new file respectively. So,I got to find out the mistake in the new code.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-> If there is a bug in a new one.We can compare old file with new file.
